# Benford-s-Law-Fraud-Detection
Benford’s law is the nonintuitive fact that the first digit of many measurements is not uniformly distributed, 
and the first digit “1” appears about 30% of the time.
If we plot whatever the distribution of the first digits is in any denomination,
the area under the curve between 1 and 2 must equal the area under the curve from 4 to 8.
We could use this law to detect fraud when a potential fraudster is making up a large amount of numbers.
